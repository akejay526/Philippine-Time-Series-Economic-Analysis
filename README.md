* REAL_GDP_GROWTH, which is defined as the real GDP growth of the Philippines
* PSEI, which is defined as the price of the Philippines Stock Exchange Index.
* BSP_RRP, which represents the rate of the Philippinesâ€™s government bond buyback program.
* UNEM, which represents the rate of unemployment in the Philippines.
